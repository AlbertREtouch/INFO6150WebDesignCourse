        <h2>What is Glaucoma?</h2>
        <p>
          Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve,
          which is vital for good vision.

        <h2>How to Recognizing Glaucoma</h2>
        <p>
          Typical glaucoma usually presents with no symptoms early in the course
          of the disease. However, it may gradually progress to involve
          difficulties with vision.It usually involves deficits in the
          peripheral vision followed by central vision loss as the disease
          progresses.

        <h2>How a Person with Glaucoma Should Take Care of Themselves</h2>
        <p>
          Avoid rubbing your eyes, even though some glaucoma medications might
          make them feel itchy or blurry.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’ve had eye surgery, it’s a good idea to wear goggles when
          swimming and protective glasses when doing yard work or when playing
          contact sports.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take care of the rest of your body. Keeping in good general health is
          just as important as taking care of your eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eat healthy foods, get enough exercise, don’t smoke, avoid ingesting
          too much caffeine, and stay at a healthy weight. Check with your
          doctor before you start any strenuous exercise program.
        </p>
        <p>Reduce stress in your life and make time for relaxation.</p>
